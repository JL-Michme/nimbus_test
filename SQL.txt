Write the query that only returns the email_address column
Join the tables together using the join_id column present in both tables
Column_1 needs to be divisible by 2 without creating a decimal number (or modulo)
column_2 needs to be smaller then column_1
Column_3 needs to end with a 1

SELECT email
FROM EMAIL_TABLE AS et JOIN DATA_TABLE AS dt ON dt.join_id = et.join_id 
WHERE Column_1 % 2 = 0
  AND Column_2 < Column_1
  AND Column_3 LIKE '%1';



in questa parte divido le parti della query :

1) Write the query that only returns the email_address column

SELECT email
FROM EMAIL_TABLE

2) Join the tables together using the join_id column present in both tables

SELECT *
FROM EMAIL_TABLE AS et JOIN DATA_TABLE AS dt ON dt.join_id = et.join_id 

3)
Column_1 needs to be divisible by 2 without creating a decimal number (or modulo)
column_2 needs to be smaller then column_1
Column_3 needs to end with a 1

SELECT *
FROM DATA_TABLE
WHERE Column_1 % 2 = 0
  AND Column_2 < Column_1
  AND Column_3 LIKE '%1';
